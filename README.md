# Configuration Scripts

### Set up Automatic Updates
Run this script to enable a cron job and automatic updates (nightly at 5AM).

### Digital Ocean & Cloudflare Firewall
This script works between a Digital Ocean Droplet and Cloudflare. After you have set up a domain name with SSL enabled, it crates and attaches a new firewall to the droplet, and then only allows traffic from Cloudflare in.
